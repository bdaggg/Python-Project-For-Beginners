you are trying to find a hidden word in my executioner project, which is a very nice project for beginners to python,
but you have the right to make four wrong guesses while doing so. you can also develop
the project by researching the python random library. 
I deliberately put some errors, one of them is that you need to solve 
this situation in case the chances of making the correct guess increase
if the user enters text instead of letters.
i will share the solved version of all the errors soon.Best of luck to you
