hello everyone, I did blackjack on this project. 
don't let it scare you that it's a little long on the basis of a simple project. 
I want you to read the codes from the beginning and then try writing them yourself. 
you can look at the code when you're stuck, but know what you're doing, don't copy and paste, try to understand the logic.
I deliberately did not complete some places, for example, in blackjack, 
A takes both the values 1 and 11, I left it blank, it is your task to complete it. 
it will be completed in the near future, I will upload the completed version, you can check it from there
Best of luck to you
